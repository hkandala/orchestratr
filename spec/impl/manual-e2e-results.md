# orchestratr — manual end-to-end test results

Observed outcomes of the manual e2e phase (master-prompt §8). The plan is in
[`manual-e2e-tests.md`](manual-e2e-tests.md). Each test is executed one at a time
against **live herdr 0.7.2** (and real `claude`/`codex` where the test says so) using a
throwaway `ORCR_HOME` + a disposable `orcr_e2e_<rand>` herdr session; after each test the
leak check (`herdr session list`) must show no `orcr`/`orcr_e2e_*` session.

This phase **reports** issues; it does not silently fix them — the one exception is
**known-issue #2** (E01/E02, the real-provider `agent ask` failure), which the plan
requires be root-caused, fixed, and covered by a regression test. Record that root
cause + fix inline in the E01/E02 rows/notes.

For each test record: expected vs actual, pass/fail, exit code, any `--json` error
`{code, details}`, and notes (screenshots/log excerpts for the TUI test). Note the leak
check result too.

## Detailed findings

_(One subsection per test as it is executed: E01 …, E02 …, with expected vs actual,
commands run, exit codes, log excerpts, and any filed issue.)_

## Issues filed

_(Running list of defects discovered, most severe first: id, test, severity, summary,
root cause if known, fix status.)_

## Leak audit

_(After the full suite: `herdr session list` output confirming no `orcr`/`orcr_e2e_*`
session leaked, and no stray `orcr server` process against a throwaway `ORCR_HOME`.)_
