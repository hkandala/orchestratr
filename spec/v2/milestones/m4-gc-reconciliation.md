# M4 · GC & reconciliation

Lifecycle at scale: parking, reaping, attach protection, drift repair, and tracking
the agents orcr didn't create. M4 is done when a hundred agents can churn for hours
and the owned session stays tidy without ever harming a pane it shouldn't.

## Scope

### GC auto (spec §5.4, §11.2)
- Tick ~30s; all transitions CAS-versioned.
- Park: turn-complete + idle ≥ `idle_after` → two-phase move to the `idle` workspace
  (`move_state: parking` → status `parked`); `home_workspace` recorded.
- Reap: parked ≥ `kill_after` → graceful kill (`exit_reason: reaped`) + pane closed.
- Un-park on `send`: `move_state: unparking`, cancel pending reap, move pane home
  (recreate the tab if gone), confirm location, status → `idle`, then deliver.
- `--gc never` exemption; no default timeout anywhere; explicit `--timeout`
  enforcement (kill with `exit_reason: timeout`).

### attach (spec §6.1)
- `agent attach <fqn|uuid> [--takeover]` — execs `herdr agent attach`; observe
  default.
- Attach leases persisted (`attaches` table: mode, connection, heartbeat); GC defers
  moves/reaps while a lease is fresh; leases cleaned on socket disconnect/heartbeat
  expiry; queued/ended targets → `state_conflict`.

### Reconciliation (spec §11.5)
- On server start + periodically: vanished panes → `lost` (fqn stays reserved) →
  resolved to `ended`; marked panes with no row → **orphan adoption**
  (`origin: orphaned`, status `lost`, never auto-closed; removable only by
  `kill --force` or a matched stale launch token); unmarked panes in the owned
  session → counted, reported, untouched; half-done `move_state` moves → completed or
  rolled back.
- `server status` gains the drift/orphan/unmarked counts.

### Unmanaged discovery (spec §5.7)
- Poll/stream herdr for agents in non-owned sessions every few seconds.
- Rows keyed by (herdr session, `terminal_id`); fqn `unmanaged.<session>.<pane>`;
  uuid like any row; new terminal = new row; terminal gone → `ended`.
- Unmanaged lifecycle statuses (working/idle/blocked/unknown/ended); the §5.7
  behavior contract enforced verb-by-verb (`kill` needs `--force`; no GC; send/wait/
  attach/logs work).

## Acceptance

- Park → send → un-park e2e: agent returns to its home workspace, clocks reset,
  delivery lands after the move confirms.
- Kill the server mid-park-move (fault injection around the herdr move) → restart →
  reconciler completes or rolls back; status/location always agree afterward.
- Attach guard: park/reap deferred while attached (including after a server restart
  with a live lease); resumes after detach.
- Orphan drill: delete the agent's store row under a live pane → reconciler adopts as
  orphan, never closes; `kill --force` cleans it.
- Foreign-pane safety: a user shell opened inside the owned session is reported and
  never touched across many GC cycles.
- Unmanaged drill: hand-start an agent in a user session → appears in `ls` within
  seconds with correct provider/status; close its pane → row `ended`; logs work when
  its herdr integration reports an `agent_session`.
- Soak: 100 mock agents churning for an hour → workspaces stay clean, no leaked
  panes, no wrongly-closed panes (assertion via herdr snapshot diff).

## Out of scope

Loops (M5), top (M6). Background-subagent detection (future; the §5.4 caveat is
documented behavior in M4).
